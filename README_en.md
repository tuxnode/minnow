[中文说明 (Chinese Version)](./README.md)

This is a hybrid learning path combining CS144 and CS168. CS168 offers up-to-date online textbooks and lecture videos with engaging instructors, while CS144 provides assignments based on modern C++. Therefore, this path satisfies the needs of learning both computer networking and modern C++.

The starter code for CS144 Fall 2025 is backed up in this repository, and the lab handouts can be found in the [handouts](./handouts/) directory. I hope this helps you.

| Stage | CS144 Lab | CS168 Lectures | Remarks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| P1 | Lab 0: ByteStream | 1. Intro 1: Layers of the Internet<br>2. Intro 2: Design Principles | Lab 0 is for getting familiar with the C++ environment. Watching the intro lectures is sufficient. |
| P2 | Lab 1: Reassembler | 3. Intro 3: Links | Lab 1 is a pure logic/algorithm problem with low theoretical prerequisites. Watch one more lecture. |
| P3 | Lab 2: TCP Receiver | 11-12. Transport 1: TCP | Lab 2 relates to the TCP protocol, so we jump ahead in lectures. CS168 focuses on Routing early on and puts TCP in the middle. |
| P4 | Lab 3: TCP Sender | 13-15. Transport 3: Congestion Control | Lab 3 also relates to TCP. We can finish the remaining CS168 TCP lectures here. |
| P5 | Lab 4: Real World | 4-6. Routing 1-2: Principles, Distance-Vector | Lab 4 requires no coding (pinging real sites and collecting data). It's a perfect time to catch up on the early Routing lectures. |
| P6 | Lab 5: Network Interface | 18-20. End-to-End: Ethernet, STP, ARP, DHCP | Lab 5 connects IP and Ethernet. We need to learn how hosts communicate within the same subnet. |
| P7 | Lab 6: IP Router | 7-8. Routing 3-4: Link-State, Addressing, Routers | Lab 6 requires implementing a software router. Go back to the first half of CS168 to review Routing. |
| P8 | Lab 7: Putting it together | 21-22. Datacenters: Topology, Routing | Lab 7 requires no coding. Catch up on the main lecture timeline. |
| P9 | No Lab | 9-10. Routing (DV, LS, BGP)<br>16-17. Applications (DNS, HTTP)<br>23. SDN<br>24-25. Beyond Client-Server: Multicast | Labs are done. Complete the remaining core lectures. |
| P10 | No Lab | 26. Wireless<br>27. Cellular | Extended content: Wi-Fi and Cellular networks. Optional. |
